    "description": "Vegetable and fruit freshness detecting can ensure that consumers get vegetables and fruits with good taste and rich nutrition, improve the health level of diet, and ensure that the agricultural and food industries provide high-quality products to meet consumer needs and increase sales and market share. At present, the freshness detection of vegetables and fruits mainly relies on manual observation and judgment, which has the problems of subjectivity and low accuracy, and it is difficult to meet the needs of large-scale, high-efficiency, and rapid detection. To solve this problem, this project will develop a novel method for detecting the freshness of vegetables and fruits more objectively, accurately and efficiently using deep features extracted by pre-trained deep learning models of different architectures."
